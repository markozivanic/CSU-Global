# CSU-Global


This repository will include code that I wrote during my time at CSU - Global, while taking ITS320 Basic Programming in Python. 
I am not responsible for someone using this code and getting bad grades or for plagiarism.

This repository is exclusively used for me storing my code in case of losing my laptop.
