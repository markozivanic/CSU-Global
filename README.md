# CSU-Global


This repository includes code that I wrote during my time at CSU - Global, while taking ITS320 Basic Programming in Python. 
I am not responsible for someone using this code in order to obtain better grades. 

This repository is exclusively used for me storing my code in case of losing my laptop.
