Module 2 - Option #1: Create a Python Application
Python has built-in string validation methods for basic data. It can check if a string is composed of alphabetical characters, alphanumeric characters, digits, etc

Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:
Read from the console an arbitrary string S of length less than 50 characters.
In the first output line, print True if S has any alphanumeric characters. Otherwise, print False. 
In the second line, print True if S has any alphabetical characters. Otherwise, print False. 
In the third line, print True if S has any digits. Otherwise, print False. 
In the fourth line, print True if S has any lowercase characters. Otherwise, print False. 
In the fifth line, print True if S has any uppercase characters. Otherwise, print False.
Develop Python code that implements the program requirements.

Module 3 - Option #1 - Create a Python Application
Implement a program that reads in a year and outputs the approximate value of a Ferrari 250 GTO in that year. Use the following table that describes the estimated value of a GTO at different times since 1962.
